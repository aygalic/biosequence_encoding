# genome_analysis_parkinson

## Intro 

This project has for goal to perform an analysis over a dataset of parkinson disease transcriptomic dataset.

## Approach

First step : performing some exploratory analysis with R

Second step : Building an auto encoder pipeline ad analysing the latent representation of the dataset to see if we can find any clusters. This is done through tensorflow and python.

Future steps : using dedicated bioinformatics package to provide further insights.
